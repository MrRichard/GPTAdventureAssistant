### Some Rules

This product should aim to:

- Enrich the experience of running a game or playing
- Be system agnositic
- Be useful for group or solo play
- Be fun to use, easy to figure out, and extremely customizable

### TODO:

- New characters and places also saved in these directories
- ALL prompt generation should search for characters / places defined in the files. Those descriptions should be included in the prompt.
