### Some Rules

This product should aim to:
- Never take away agency of a character or GM
- Enrich the experience of running a game or playing
- Be system agnositic
- Be useful for group or solo play
- Be fun to use, easy to figure out, and extremely customizable
- Be free to distribute and 

### TODO:
- Character and Place directories scan on start
- New characters and places also saved in these directories
- ALL prompt generation should search for characters / places defined in the files. Those descriptions should be included in the prompt.
- Generating new characters - INPROGRESS. Currently very bland. Needs to have a "Generating" indicator.
- Generating new places
- "Look at this map" Situational sidequest encounter - based on initial tests, this is "video-gamey" and kinda sucks
